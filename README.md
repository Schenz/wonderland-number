# Wonderland Number

## Overview

Wonderland is a strange place.  There is a wonderland number that is
also quite strange.

You must find a way to generate this wonderland number.

- It has six digits
- If you multiply it by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, the resulting number has all
  the same digits in at as the original number.  The only difference
  is the position that they are in.

Once you have found this number, take it to the next level removing the six digit rule, but still applying the multiplication rules. See how many you can find in under a second. I found a solution that can find 1000 numbers in under 20ms.

## Goal

The primary objective of this kata is to explore creative problem-solving strategies.

I recommend starting with a function that accepts the number of wonderland numbers you wish to find and outputs an array of the numbers. Once you have the solution to the first one, start incrementing the number you want to find and pay attention to how long it takes as you increase the number. Don't over optimize when you start to ensure you have followed all the rules, but when your solution goes over a couple seconds to run think of ways to make small improvements based on critical thinking, mathematical reasoning, and algorithmic skills. 

I have also included an [Excel Spreadsheet](/Wonderland-Number.xlsx) which performs the matmatical equation over a single number so you can verify if your results are correct.
